# Fintual task

The following is a simple implementation solving the following task.
> Construct a simple Portfolio class that has a collection of Stocks. Assume each Stock has a “Current Price” method that receives the last available price. Also, the Portfolio class has a collection of “allocated” Stocks that represents the distribution of the Stocks the Portfolio is aiming (i.e. 40% META, 60% APPL)
Provide a portfolio rebalance method to know which Stocks should be sold and which ones should be bought to have a balanced Portfolio based on the portfolio’s allocation.

The solution has been made with simplicity in mind and solves only what is requires and does not expand more.
